# twitchproject
FreeCodeCamp assignment - an application that displays the stream status of users

The project utilizes calls to Twitch.tv's API. FreeCodeCamp provided an alternative Endpoint, which this project uses, to enable calling the API without a key.

Thus, instead of using https://api.twitch.tv/kraken, this project uses https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api as an endpoint according to the Twitch API documentation.
